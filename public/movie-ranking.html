<h1>The Best Movies According to Tokugawa</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favourite anime. The teachings behind each Miyazaki's story is meaningful.</p>
<h3>Totoro</h3>
<p>It strikes my core childhood memory</p>
<h3>First Love</h3>
<p>Classic nostalgia. It makes you think back to your own love story when you first blossom.</p>
